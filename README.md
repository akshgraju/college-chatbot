## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Uses NLTK and a Keras/TensorFlow model to understand user intent.
- **Web Interface:** A user-friendly chat widget built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Easily Trainable:** Add new patterns and responses by simply editing the `intents.json` file.
- **Ready for Deployment:** Built with a Flask/Gunicorn backend, ready to be hosted online.
